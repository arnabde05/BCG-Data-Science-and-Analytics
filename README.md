The tasks I was required to complete as a part of the BCG Open-Access Data Science &amp; Advanced Analytics Virtual Experience Program are all contained in this repository. 

## Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing

PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.

A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, knowing which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current price is helpful, for which a good predictive model could be useful.

Moreover, for customers at risk of churning, a discount might incentivize them to stay with our client. The head of the SME division is considering a 20% discount that is considered large enough to dissuade almost anyone from churning (especially those for whom price is the primary concern).

The Associate Director (AD) held an initial team meeting to discuss various hypotheses, including churn due to price sensitivity. After a discussion with your team, you have been asked to go deeper into the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities. 

Your AD wants an email with your thoughts on how the team should go about testing this hypothesis.

The client plans to use the predictive model on the 1st working day of every month to indicate to which customers the 20% discount should be offered.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

The BCG project team thinks that building a churn model to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of churn has potential. The client has sent over some data and the AD wants you to perform some exploratory data analysis.

The data that was sent over includes:

Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc
Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc
Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not

Please submit analysis in a code script, notebook, or PDF format. 

Please note, there are multiple ways to approach the task and that the sample answer is just one way to do it.


## Feature Engineering & Modelling

The team now has a good understanding of the data and feels confident to use the data to further understand the business problem. The team now needs to brainstorm and build out features to uncover signals in the data that could inform the churn model.

Feature engineering is one of the keys to unlocking predictive insight through mathematical modeling. Based on the data that is available and was cleaned, identify what you think could be drivers of churn for our client and build those features to later use in your model.

First focus on building on top of the feature that your colleague has already investigated: “the difference between off-peak prices in December and January the preceding year”. After this, if you have time, feel free to get creative with making any other features that you feel are worthwhile.

Once you have a set of features, you must train a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn and evaluate the performance of the model with suitable evaluation metrics. Be rigorous with your approach and give full justification for any decisions made by yourself as the intern data scientist. 

Recall that the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and that it would be possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model.

If you’re eager to go the extra mile for the client, when you have a trained predictive model, remember to investigate the client’s proposed discounting strategy, with the head of the SME division suggesting that offering customers at high propensity to churn a 20% discount might be effective.

Build your models and test them while keeping in mind you would need data to prove/disprove the hypotheses, as well as to test the effect of a 20% discount on customers at high propensity to churn.


## Findings & Recommendations

The client wants a quick update on the project progress.

The AD wants you to draft an abstract (executive summary) of your findings so far.
